Thanks to the three reviewers for some very helpful comments which have led to many improvements of the paper. My response are in black, the reviewers' comments are in red.

> p.10, l.1-15 It wasn't clear to me why the subtraction was performed in the equation (2) because I couldn't find any description for the global coordinate system of the canvas. The value of y could be negative. Please add the description how to deal with the coordinate system, especially the y-axis.

The reason why the subtraction is performed was originally given in the following paragraph of Equation (2).

> p1, l32: "information, and events." - remove the comma

We have removed the comma and elsewhere, and adjusted the language based on the comments.

> p2, l9: "grammar of graphics" - provide reference immediately here and not only later in the article and explain what the grammar of graphics is; also "piped into" may not be understood by outsiders

Done.

> Fig.1 (& related figs): I suppose you use a "3-class Dark2" color scheme from Rcolorbrewer? This does not work well when printed in grayscale: The colors become almost indistinguishable. ...

We have changed the colour scheme from "Dark2" to "4-class PuOr" (without faint orange) in Figure 1 and all consecutive figures.

> Fig.4: Colors orange & purple are hard to distinguish in grayscale. Moreover, you should use different colors here as these 2 colors are already related to the 3 stations.

We have changed the colour to red and blue picked from a "4-class RdYlBu" colour scheme, which is different from the colours used for the 3 stations.

> Fig.2: Instead of "Jan 2016" ... "Jan 2017", be specific and list "Jan 1, 2016" ... "Jan 1, 2017"

Done.

> Fig.2: Can you match the minor gridlines with the start of a month, rather than the middle of a month? This will make it much easier to identify the approximate dates for some of the other spikes. No need to label these minor gridlines.

Done.

> Fig.2: You mention "small multiples" only in a figure caption. This concept is a central
part of your calendar graphics and should be summarized in more details (including references) in the main text. Also mention Unwin & Valero-Mora's "Ensemble Graphics", JCGS, 27(1), as a major concept that applies to both sets of related figures in your article.

ToDo

> Fig.3: Add ticmarks at 0 and 24. See whether ticmark labels fit. If not, OK to omit those for 0 and 24.

Done.
