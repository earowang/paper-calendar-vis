We have done minor revision on our manuscript titled, "Calendar-based graphics for visualizing people's daily schedules," based on associate editor and reviewers' comments.

A detailed response letter to reviewers has been provided.

We believe that this manuscript has been improved, that is a good fit for the Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics.
